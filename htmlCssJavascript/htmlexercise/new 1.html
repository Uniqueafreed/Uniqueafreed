<p>On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are<br>
 designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document.<br>
 You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, listscover pages, <br>
 and other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams,<br>
 they also coordinate with your current document look.<br>
You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by choosing<br> a look for the selected<br>
 text from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can also format text directly by using<br>
 the other controls on the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using<br>
 the look from the current theme or using a format that you specify directly.
To change the overall look of your document, choose new<br>
 Theme elements on the Page Layout tab. To change the looks available in<br>
 the Quick Style gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style Set command.<br>
 Both the Themes gallery and the Quick Styles gallery provide reset commands so that <br>
 you can always restore the look of your document to the original contained in your current template.
